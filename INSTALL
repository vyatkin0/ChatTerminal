Basic Installation
==================

 These are generic installation instructions.

 The simplest way to compile ChatTerminal is:

### Windows Installation ###

  1. Open project file msvc\ChatTerminal.vcproj using Microsoft Visual C++.

  2. Build the project.

### Linux and Mac OS X Installation ###

  1. 'cd' to the directory containing the package's source code;

  2. 'cd' to the 'make' directory;

  3. Type 'make' to compile the package. On systems where 'iconv' is not a part
     of standard C library (Mac OS X)  type 'make chatterm_LIBS="-liconv"'
     to compile the program;

  4. You can copy created 'ChatTerm' and 'chatterm10.xsd' files to any folder
     which you want to run the ChatTerminal from;

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing 'make clean'.
